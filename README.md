## üõ†Ô∏è Set Up

  ###  Prerequisites: Install PostgreSQL and pgAdmin

  1. Install PostgreSQL
  2. Install pgAdmin
  3. Create a database
     - After installation, create a new database for the app (e.g., tracktrip_db).

```bash
   psql -U postgres
   CREATE DATABASE tracktrip_db;
```

 4. Update database configuration
    - In your Flask app config (or .env file), update the database URI:
```bash
    app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'postgresql://postgres:<yourpassword>@localhost:5432/tracktrip_db'
```
Replace <yourpassword> with your actual PostgreSQL password.


 ### Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git https://github.com/luciayin9944/TrackTrip_App.git
   cd TrackTrip_App
  ```


### Set Up the Backend

    ```bash
    pipenv install && pipenv shell
    cd server
    export FLASK_APP=app.py
    flask db init
    flask db migrate -m "initial migration"
    flask db upgrade head
    python seed.py
    ```

Run the Flask server:

    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

### Start the Frontend
In another terminal, from the client directory:

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    npm run dev
